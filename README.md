## Project Goals
Building human genome visualizations for the next generation of CRISPR enthusiasts, genome sequencers, and bioinformatics engineers.

We live in a day and age where genetic editing is becoming more prevalent - the pivotal 2012 CRISPR paper by Dr. Doudna and Dr. Charpentier has led to the creation of several applications to the initial CAS-9 System, especially around the cures to common somatic cell autoimmune diseases. Leveraging our knowledge of CRISPR, alongside the NLM NCBI libraries, we look to visualize the Hemoglobin Beta B genes associated with Sickle Cell Anemia as a stepping stone to better visualizing how CRISPR CAS-9 systems can affect the mutated regions. In doing so, we can better communicate the efficacy of treatments such as CASGEVY to a younger audience of students within the K-12 system, and inspire students to learn more about genome sequencing and editing. 

## Approach
Develop a querying tool to isolate Hemoglobin Beta B genes from the NCBI Database, and visualize these genes using the Ziro Studio Platform. We look to do this by: 


1) Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the Entrez packages within the Gene Library in the NCBI NLM Library to identify individual nucleotide sequences for a baseline Hemoglobin, and a mutated Hemoglobin Strand

2) Use information from the Jupyter Notebook to create a 3D Visualization of Hemoglobin genes through the Ziro Studio platform, using python
   

If time, look into the ICN3D package, alongside the ability to edit Ziro Studio's Github repository to ensure that this project can be integrated end to end
